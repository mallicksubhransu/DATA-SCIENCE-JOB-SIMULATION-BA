## Project Overview

This project aims to:
- Scrape and collect customer feedback from third-party sources.
- Analyze the sentiment of customer reviews.
- Generate a word cloud of keywords used in the reviews.
- Predict customer buying behavior using a Random Forest model.
- Present the findings and insights using PowerPoint.

## Data Collection

1. **Scrape Customer Feedback**: 
   - Use web scraping tools (e.g., BeautifulSoup, Scrapy) to collect customer reviews from third-party websites.
   - Save the scraped data into a structured format (e.g., CSV, JSON).

2. **Preprocess the Data**: 
   - Clean the data by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing text.

## Sentiment Analysis

1. **Text Preprocessing**:
   - Tokenize the text.
   - Remove stop words, punctuation, and perform stemming/lemmatization.

2. **Perform Sentiment Analysis**:
   - Use a pre-trained sentiment analysis model (e.g., VADER, TextBlob) to analyze the sentiment of each review.
   - Classify the sentiment into categories such as positive, negative, and neutral.

## Keyword Analysis

1. **Generate Word Cloud**:
   - Extract keywords from the reviews.
   - Use a word cloud library (e.g., WordCloud in Python) to visualize the most frequently used keywords.

## Buying Behavior Prediction

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Prepare the dataset by selecting relevant features for predicting buying behavior.
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.

2. **Train Random Forest Model**:
   - Implement a Random Forest model using a library like scikit-learn.
   - Train the model on the prepared dataset.

3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
   - Present the evaluation results in a structured format.

## Results Presentation

1. **Create PowerPoint Presentation**:
   - Summarize the findings from the sentiment analysis, keyword analysis, and buying behavior prediction.
   - Use PowerPoint to create slides that effectively communicate the insights and results.
