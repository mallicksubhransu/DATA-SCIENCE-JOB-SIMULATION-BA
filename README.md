# DATA-SCIENCE-JOB-SIMULATION-BRITISH-AIRWAYS
I developed a predictive model to identify the factors influencing customer buying behavior. The project involved web scraping customer review data using Beautiful Soup, followed by in-depth data analysis to extract key insights. This experience honed my skills in data collection, data cleaning, and building predictive models, providing valuable insights into customer preferences and behaviors for British Airways.
